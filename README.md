A project for a fictional drumming blog where users can read about everything related to drums, percussion, techniques and general music news.

## Description

This project was created for Project Exam 1, the final project of the first year at NOROFF Frontend design course. For this project I was tasked with creating a blog website with a theme of my choice where I had to use stuff I've learned the two first semesters. The blog posts for the site were to be added in WordPress, using it as a headless CMS, and fetching them using REST API to display them as a carousel/slider on the front page and on a separate page dedicated to the blog posts. The post content had to be fetched using query strings, making the individual blog post page dynamic showing only the details of the post the user clicked on on either the front page or blog list page.

Some of the prerequisites were:

- A carousel/slider on the front page showing the latest blog posts
- The blog list page should show a number of posts with a button to show the rest
- The blog specific page should be dynamically built using query strings
- A contact form with requirements like "minimum 5 characters"
